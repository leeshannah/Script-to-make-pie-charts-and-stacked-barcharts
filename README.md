# Script to make pie charts and stacked barcharts
Script to make pie charts and stacked bar charts of lipid annotations with consistent palette

**Script input**: csv output from Agilent Masshunter Lipid Annotator

**Script output**: pie charts for each csv uploaded, with the same color palette across the lipid classes identified, labeled with % of total annotations and parent species name. Stacked bar charts faceted by each lipid annotator csv with same color palette as pie charts. Values shown as total counts (rather than relative abundance), so number of annotations can be compared across different lipid annotator csvs.

Script is available as .R, .RMD and .ipynb.
